=============================================

Demo code from my talk in NNUG Trondheim 27. September 2012 about writing robust integration tests that depends on external files: http://trondheim.nnug.no/events/82962882/

The solution contains a class that simplifies file handeling of deployed files, configuration files and files embedded as resources.
